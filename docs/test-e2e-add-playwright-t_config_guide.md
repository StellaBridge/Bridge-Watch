# Configuration and Runtime Setup: test(e2e): add Playwright tests for alert configuration flow

## Context & Objectives
Operational configuration specification for `Bridge-Watch` addressing issue #1358.

## Architecture & Configuration
- **Configuration Boundary**: Defines validated environment variables and runtime thresholds.
- **Fail-Safe Behavior**: System fails closed upon invalid, missing, or malformed parameters.
- **Local Isolation**: Recommends containerized or local testnet sandbox execution.

## Deployment Notes
- Verify all required configuration keys in `.env` before application boot.
- Monitor application telemetry for unexpected configuration desynchronization.
